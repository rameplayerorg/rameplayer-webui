                    <p>To set up Cluster for use in RamePlayer, first go to the web UI of the Main Player unit.<br>
                    Go to <span class="key">Settings</span> (the spanner icon)
                    and in the Cluster settings, press the <span class="key">Add Unit</span> button</p>

                    <p><br>
                    Write IP addresses of other RamePlayers to the <span class="key">IP Address</span> field, default port is 8000. Use a delay of 10 seconds for Backup players.

                    <br>Press <span class="key">+ Add</span> to add the player to the cluster.

Insert all players to the cluster except the Main player.</p>
<img alt="Cluster Configuration 02" class="img-responsive" src="img/cluster/helpimg_cluster_02.png">
<p>Cluster of 2 players ready (main player and one backup player with a 10 second delay).
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>Synchronizing Playlists for Cluster</h3><br>
                    <h4>Creating playlists for players</h4>
                    <p>Every player should have their playlist set up ready in their language, see <b>Player usage</b> for more help with playlists.</p><br><img alt="Playlist ready and saved" class="img-responsive" src="img/cluster/helpimg_cluster_03.png">
<p>Playlist saved as "English" is ready for synchronizing.</p>
<br><br>

<h4>Synchronizing Playlists</h4>
<p>To control a cluster of players, the playlists must be synchronized to start together:</p>
<p>1. From the saved playlist of the Main player: press the settings button on the right hand corner and select <span class="key">Synchronize</span></p>
<img alt="Finding synchronize" class="img-responsive" src="img/cluster/helpimg_cluster_04.png">
<p><br>2. Select the correct player and playlist to use</p>
<img alt="Choosing the playlist" class="img-responsive" src="img/cluster/helpimg_cluster_05.png">
<p><br>3. Repeat for every additional player and playlist in the cluster.<br><br>Remember that all of the playlist sync settings have to be done from the Main Player unit.</p>
<br>
                    <h3>Cluster Use</h3>
                    <p>To use the cluster, keep the the WebUI of Main player open.</p>
                    <p>Note that the cluster "exists" only in the browser - the cluster setup is not saved to any of the players.</p>
                    <p>Below is an example image of two-unit cluster in use, with a "backup player" playing using 10 second delay.</p>
<img alt="Cluster playing" class="img-responsive" src="img/cluster/helpimg_cluster_06.png">
<br>
                    <h4>Cluster With Varying Playlists</h4>
                    <p>You might use a cluster with different playlist in each player.
                    For example, one player might have media files in different language,
                    but only a few of the files available instead of all of them.
                    When synchronizing a player with such playlist, empty "&mdash;" entries will be added to
                    end of the synchronized playlist to match playlist lengths.
                    Drag using the menu handles on the right to re-order the items as needed
                    (including empty entries). Make sure that media file is in matching position
                    and empty entries are in the correct places.</p>
                    <p>Below is an example image of three-unit cluster, where one of the players have a playlist
                    containing only two items. The synchronized playlist is already sorted in the image.<br>

                    <br>0 / 90 / 180 / 270 degrees. Default=0.
                    <br><strong>Audio port</strong>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Analog

                    <br><strong>Mono audio</strong> checkbox: Allows converting the output stereo audio to mono. Works only with an actual RamePlayer unit which has a Cirrus audio board inside.
                    <strong>Device name</strong> (hostname).
                    <br>Only letters &amp; numbers allowed (no "special characters").
                    <br><strong>IP configuration</strong>
                        <ul>
                        <p>By default RamePlayer configures IP settings using DHCP.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively IP settings can be configured manually:</p>
                        <li>Device IP and subnet mask are mandatory
                        <li>Gateway IP and DNS are optional (but required for internet connectivity)
                        <li>Use as DHCP server (optional): RamePlayer can also function as a DHCP server, handing out IPs to other devices in same network, using the given DHCP IP range.
                        <p>Be careful with defining the range so that it does not overlap with any devices having statically configured IP. Also make sure you have only a single DHCP server in the network!</p>
                        </ul>
                    <strong>Time configuration</strong>
                        <ul>
                        <p>Note: WebUI shows current device time in UTC, not with the selected time zone.</p>
                        <li>NTP servers &mdash; Player is automatically synchronized to correct time if NTP server is configured and the player is connected to the internet. You can enter multiple NTP servers by separating them with a comma.
                        <li>If device is not connected to internet, you can also manually set date &amp; time (using UTC time).
                        <p>Note: If NTP server is defined, the automatic time synchronization will override any manually entered time when player is connected to the internet.</p>
                        </ul>
                    <strong>Save settings</strong> &mdash; The UI may additionally inform if a restart is required to apply the changes. If you change the IP address, note that you have to enter the new IP address to your browser window.
                    <br>
                    <br><strong>Factory reset</strong> &mdash; Restores all default settings and deletes internally stored data.
                    <br><em>Factory reset is not recommended unless it is necessary!</em>
                    <p>After Factory reset, the player will need to re-detect available hardware components and it will restart twice.
                    Player startup will take longer than usual.
                    You may need to additionally hard reboot (power off and on again) afterwards.</p>

                    <strong>Volumes</strong> &mdash; Available when analog audio port setting is enabled.
                    Volume selection must be expanded first, to minimize possibility of changing the volume by mistake.
                        <ul>
                        <li>Line out volume &ndash; Range: 0...110%
                        <li>Headphone volume &ndash; Range: 0...100%. Can also be adjusted using the rotary of local UI (seen in WebUI only with page reload).
                        </ul>
                    <strong>Firmware upgrade</strong>
                        <br>Requires connection to the internet.
                        Select one of the available firmwares, press Upgrade and wait until RamePlayer reboots automatically.
                        <p>Note: Downgrading to older firmware is not recommended
                        (may lead to non-functioning device, especially when downgrading more than a minor patch level).</p>
                        <p>If screen stays white after firmware upgrade to a new major version: You may need an additional hard reboot (power off and on again).</p>
                    <strong>Restart device</strong> &mdash; Performs a "soft reboot".
                        <p>(You can do a hard reboot by switching off the player from power switch and back on after a moment.)</p>
                    <strong>RamePlayer Information</strong>

              <h4>Connecting to ATEM video mixers</h4>
              <p>Verify what mode ATEM mixer is configured to use (720p or 1080p).
              Set RamePlayer to use the same mode. (See images below.)
              If ATEM is in 720p mode, it will still report being 1080p capable
              in HDMI handshake, so RamePlayer will send image in wrong format
              if it is using Auto video output resolution.</p>
              <p>After saving settings, you have to
              hard reboot the RamePlayer (power off, wait a little while, power on again).</p>
              <p>Additionally you may need to detach HDMI cable from RamePlayer before
              turning it on, reattach the cable back after RamePlayer is running.</p>
              <p>The above steps are needed so that new settings are correctly between
              ATEM and RamePlayer.</p>
